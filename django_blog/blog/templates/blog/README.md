Tagging & Search features
- Models:
  - Tag (name)
  - Post.tags: ManyToManyField to Tag
- Adding tags:
  - On create/edit post, enter comma-separated names in the "tags" field. New tags are created automatically.
- URLs:
  - /tags/<tag_name>/  -> posts with that tag
  - /search/?q=term     -> search posts by title/content/tags
- Templates:
  - Post detail and list pages display tags. Tags link to /tags/<tag_name>/
- Notes:
  - Tag names are lowercased on save to avoid duplicates.
  - Search uses icontains (case-insensitive) across title, content, and tag name.
